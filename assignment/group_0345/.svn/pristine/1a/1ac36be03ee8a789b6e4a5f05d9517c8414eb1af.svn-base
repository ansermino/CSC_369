Discussion: Starvation is possible to happen during execution. Despite our locking scheme for quadrants should follow the rule that threads lock in order one to four, phtread_mutex_lock does not 
				have any specific order(e.g FIFO) about which thread should get the lock if multiple thread calling for the same lock. For example ,If there is a thread(T1) waiting for the lock,
				and another thread(T2) calls phtread_mutex_lock after T1, it is possible that T2 will acquire the lock instead of T1. If such case happens multiple time, that is, T1 keeps waiting while
				multiple other threads arrive, keep trying to acquire the lock and keep getting the lock, then T1 starves. Therefore, starvation is possible. 
				One possible solution to prevent this case is to build a queue for the thread, so the first one who arrive should always get the lock.
